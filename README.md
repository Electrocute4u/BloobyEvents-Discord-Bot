# Blooby Events Discord Bot

## What is this project?
Blooby Events Discord Bot is an official tool for the Bloobyboi's Events, offering information on events such as but not limited to Redrover, Block Party, Floor is Lava and many more. Initially, it provides event details and player stats. As it integrates with the private API, the bot will track active and past events, display temporary leaderboards, and update real-time event data. The bot aims to give players easy access to event information, stats, and event winners, with more features coming as the API evolves over time. Originally developed for players as a User Install, but its also available for any interested partnered server owner(s) to add to their own server as a Discord bot.
